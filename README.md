This is the repository for my personal/portfolio homepage.

## Setup and Usage

I'm using Vue.js and yarn as my package manager. If you don't want to use yarn simply replace ```yarn``` with ```npm```
```
yarn install - install all dependencies 
yarn serve - compile and show website
yarn build - build application for deployment
```
