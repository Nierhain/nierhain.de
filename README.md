This is the repository for my personal/portfolio homepage.

## Setup and Usage

I'm using yarn as my package manager. If you don't want to use yarn simply replace ```yarn``` with ```npm```
```
yarn install - install all dependencies 
yarn build - build application for deployment
```

## Design guidelines

I'm a big fan of the [Dracula Theme](https://www.draculatheme.com), therefore I incorporated it into my homepage theme.
